Idk if you make it here or where you make it but her you go.

The ComPatchedStorage mod is broken, when ever you try to craft a chest it does not craft a chest but instead gives you back your items.
And for if you already had a Compact Chest before this bug your items disappear when ever you try to do something in that chest, you items
will come back if you close and open the chest again. 

This bug happened after I updated to 4.0.2, and it does not only do this for me, it does it for other people too.
